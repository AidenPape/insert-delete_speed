# insert-delete_speed
Testing the speeds of inserting and removing items from various data structures

Each .dat file has a list of insertions and deletions. the program TimeTest reads through the file and uses the created data structures to add and remove per the .dat file. The TimeTest file records the time it takes for each data structure. For results and write up, see TimeTest_results.pdf

Data Structures tested:

Linked List
Stack (implemented with an array)
Stack (implemented with a linked list)
Queue (implemented with a linked list)
ArrayList
Array

To run, download files including .dat files and run TimeTest.java
